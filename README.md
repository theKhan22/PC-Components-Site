# PC-Components-Site
An e-commerce site specialized for the pc building community




For my project I am going to design an ‘E-Commerce Site’. To be more specific it is going to be a site which will sell pc components exclusively. Most websites which sell tech gear, aren’t really specialized to serve the pc enthusiasts community. So, my main focus will be to make the site well suited for the pc building community and also make sure the admin side provides sufficient features for the owner.
The site will consist of various important features such filtering results, maintaining a history of the orders and many more. The users will get to enjoy a feature called build a pc, which will allow them to build a virtual pc in the site. This feature will make the user experience of the site much more professional and efficient. Other than this, various other factors will be provided. The user will be able keep track of his/her ordered products and also sort them using the price. I believe this feature will help the user to properly monitors his/her orders and make necessary changes. A categorized view will be provided, where the user will be able to browse a certain type of pc component, which will make navigation through the site much easier and understandable.

The admin side will also consist of various important features to maximize the efficiency and run the business smoothly. One important feature is , the admin will be able to view the current orders and it’s relevant information. Having a proper knowledge about the current sales is an integral part of every successful business. Some advance sorting methods will be used to filter out products. One of which will be to sort the inventory in the order of quantity. This feature will enable the admin to keep track of their inventory and restock accordingly. The admin will be able to see the current list of registered users along with their relevant information. I plan on adding a private message feature which will enable the admin to directly deal with the concerns of the users.

This site will be built for serving the pc building community and provide them with an easy and efficient UI to make the user experience as convenient as possible.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100114001/199780835-ef8a82ae-9c5f-4548-a31f-f7667d6adcbd.png)
